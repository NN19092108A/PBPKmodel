# NN19092108A-PBPKmodel

This MATLAB code runs the PBPK model in Chan, Anahtar, et al., Nature Nanotechnology, Under revision. 
The .m file is all that is needed. The exhaled breath concentrations are output into the ExhPPB.mat file after each run. 

All exhaled breath curves in the paper should be reproducible by changing the appropriate parameters. If any discrepancies are observed, please notify the authors.
