# NN19092108A-PBPKmodel

This MATLAB code runs the PBPK model in Chan, Anahtar, et al., Nature Nanotechnology, March 2020. 
The .m file is all that is needed. The exhaled breath concentrations are output into the ExhPPB.mat file after each run. 

All exhaled breath curves in the paper should be reproducible by changing the appropriate parameters. If this is not the case it is an honest mistake on behalf of the authors, and we would appreciate being notified of any discrepancies.
